        The questions are multilingual (either in English, Chinese, or French) and multimodal (containing images as part of the question).  
        
        Question Format:
        - Context: The given financial context.
        - Sub-Questions: A series of related sub-questions tied to the same context and images. Later questions may depend on the answers to earlier ones. Each sub-question has a seperate question type (multiple-choice or open-ended), indicated at the beginning of the sub-question.
        - Images: Image placeholders like '<image_1>', '<image_2>' refer to accompanying images. If images are mentioned, they will be included alongside the textual context. If no images are provided, answer based solely on the textual context.
        
        Answering Guidelines:
        For each sub-question, provide:        
        - Answer:
            For multiple-choice questions, return the option index.
            For open-ended questions, provide a concise and precise answer.
        - Explanation: Provide a clear and detailed explanation (maximum 200 words) for your answer in the same language as the question.

        Now consider the following question:
        context: {{context}}
        {{sub_questions}} 
        
        Your response must be in a standard JSON format and should follow this structure:
        ```json
        {
        subquestion-1: {
            answer: <answer-1>,
            explanation: <explanation-1>
        },
        subquestion-2: {
            answer: <answer-2>,
            explanation: <explanation-2>
        },
        subquestion-3: {
            answer: <answer-3>,
            explanation: <explanation-3>
        },
        ...
        }
        ```
        Ensure that the response strictly adheres to JSON syntax without any additional content.

    Here are the definitions for each error type:
    perceptual errors: these occur when the model misinterprets basic visual information. Perceptual errors involve misunderstandings of elementary visual details or lack of specialized knowledge.
    lack of knowledge: this type of error occurs due to insufficient specialized knowledge. The model may correctly identify visual elements but fail to interpret them accurately in context.
    reasoning errors: these errors arise when the model correctly understands text and images but fails to apply logical or mathematical reasoning effectively. 
    other errors: this category includes errors not covered by the above types, such as Textual Understanding Errors, Rejection to Answer, Annotation Errors, and Answer Extraction Errors. These involve challenges in interpreting complex text, limitations in response generation, inaccuracies in data annotation, and difficulties in extracting precise answers.

    The input is as follows; use these details to determine the primary error category.

    context: {context}

    model's explanation: {model_explanation}
